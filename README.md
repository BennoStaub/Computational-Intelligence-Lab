This repository is used to share my exam cheatsheet for the Computational Intelligence Lab course at ETH Zurich in 2017.
Achieved grade: 5.5, where 6 is the maximum possible grade.

This cheatsheet covers all the theory from the course and therefore should rather be seen as a summary for your exam preparation. Instead of copying it, I recommend you to use it as reference while creating your own personal and more efficient cheatsheet.

There is no guarantee for correctness or completeness. 

For questions etc. feel free to contact staubbe@student.ethz.ch

This repository has also been used for a short project covered in this course.
